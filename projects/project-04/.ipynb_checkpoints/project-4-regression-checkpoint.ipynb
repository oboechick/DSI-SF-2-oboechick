    "[San Francisco provides a wealth of data on the city to the public.](https://data.sfgov.org/) Project 4 is all about exploring this data and modeling interesting relationships with regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project 4 is also much more open-ended than the previous projects. You are more responsible for finding things about the data that interest you, coming up with your own hypothesis about it, and reporting on the analysis you carry out. That being said, there are still specific requirements and restrictions on the type of models you will be constructing.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have gone through the above website and pulled out a variety of different datasets that we think are particularly interesting. Some of the datasets are from external sources as well, but all are related to San Francisco. A high level overview of data folders is provided after the project requirements section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is a lot of different data. You are _NOT_ expected to explore all of it or include all of it in analyses.** The point of the project is to focus on aspects of San Francisco that are particularly interesting to you from a modeling point of view. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The uncompressed data is a large filesize.** Even the compressed data is pretty large. The data is compressed into a .7z format which has one of the smallest filesizes available. You will likely need a 3rd party app to extract it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Utilities for .7z\n",
    "- For OSX [Keka](http://www.kekaosx.com/en/) or [The Unarchiver](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html). \n",
    "- For Windows [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) is the standard. \n",
    "- For Linux try the `p7zip` utility.  `sudo apt-get install p7zip`.\n",

    "## Project requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will be performing 4 different sections of analysis on the San Francisco data.**\n",

    "**Models must be regression. This means that your target variable needs to be numeric/continuous**\n",
