       " '<p><a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jasontrue\">My StackOverflow CV</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Ceramic collector, obsessive cook, entrepreneur and professional geek.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was doing a one-person consultancy for a couple of years, doing some Rails stuff, some .Net services work, and some work in Groovy/Java for a pharmaceutical firm called Dendreon. When that project wrapped up, I took a Rails-focused job at a hybrid Ruby/C# shop, Getty Images.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m interested in functional languages like Scala and F# but have relatively limited real-world experience with them.</p>\\n\\n<p>In previous lives, I\\'ve worked for Microsoft, Revenue Science (now Audience Science), Zillow, and a travel company called Virtuoso, the Seattle Times, and a very strange financial/transportation conglomerate.</p>\\n\\n<p>My long term professional ambition is to find a way to work from Tokyo/Kawasaki/Yokohama either 100% or via frequent travel or remote work opportunities. If you\\'re interested in tracking down a reasonably competent Rails or ASP.net MVC guy and are located near Seattle, WA or Tokyo, Japan or don\\'t mind me working mostly remotely, feel free to contact me.</p>\\n',\n",
